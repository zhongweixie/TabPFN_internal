Tabular data, spreadsheets organized in rows and columns, are ubiquitous acrossscientifc felds, from biomedicine to particle physics to economics and climatescience1,2 . The fundamental prediction task of flling in missing values of a labelcolumn based on the rest of the columns is essential for various applications asdiverse as biomedical risk models, drug discovery and materials science. Althoughdeep learning has revolutionized learning from raw data and led to numeroushigh-profle success stories3–5 , gradient-boosted decision trees6–9 have dominatedtabular data for the past 20 years. Here we present the Tabular Prior-data FittedNetwork (TabPFN), a tabular foundation model that outperforms all previousmethods on datasets with up to 10,000 samples by a wide margin, using substantiallyless training time. In 2.8 s, TabPFN outperforms an ensemble of the strongestbaselines tuned for 4 h in a classifcation setting. As a generative transformer-basedfoundation model, this model also allows fne-tuning, data generation, densityestimation and learning reusable embeddings. TabPFN is a learning algorithm that isitself learned across millions of synthetic datasets, demonstrating the power of thisapproach for algorithm development. By improving modelling abilities across diversefelds, TabPFN has the potential to accelerate scientifc discovery and enhanceimportant decision-making in various domains.

Throughout the history of artificial intelligence, manually createdalgorithmic components have been replaced with better-performingend-to-end learned ones. Hand-designed features in computer vision,such as SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform)10 and HOG (Histogramof Oriented Gradients)11, have been replaced by learned convolutions;grammar-based approaches in natural language processing have beenreplaced by learned transformers12; and the design of customized open-ing and end-game libraries in game playing has been superseded byend-to-end learned strategies3,13. Here we extend this end-to-endlearning to the ubiquitous domain of tabular data.

The diversity of tabular data sets them apart from unprocessedmodalities such as text and images. While in language modelling forexample the meaning of a word is consistent across documents, intabular datasets the same value can mean fundamentally differentthings. A drug discovery dataset, for example, might record chemicalproperties, whereas another dataset in materials science might docu-ment thermal and electric properties. This specialization leads to aproliferation of smaller, independent datasets and associated models.To illustrate, on the popular tabular benchmarking website openml.org,$76 \%$ of the datasets contain less than 10,000 rows at the time of writing.

Deep learning methods have traditionally struggled with tabulardata, because of the heterogeneity between datasets and the heteroge-neity of the raw data itself: Tables contain columns, also called features,with various scales and types (Boolean, categorical, ordinal, integer,

floating point), imbalanced or missing data, unimportant features,outliers and so on. This made non-deep-learning methods, such astree-based models, the strongest contender so far14,15.

However, these traditional machine learning models have sev-eral drawbacks. Without substantial modifications, they yield poorout-of-distribution predictions and poor transfer of knowledge fromone dataset to another16. Finally, they are hard to combine with neuralnetworks, as they do not propagate gradients.

As a remedy, we introduce TabPFN, a foundation model for small-to medium-sized tabular data. This new supervised tabular learningmethod can be applied to any small- to moderate-sized dataset andyields dominant performance for datasets with up to 10,000 samplesand 500 features. In a single forward pass, TabPFN significantly out-performs state-of-the-art baselines on our benchmarks, includinggradient-boosted decision trees, even when these are allowed 4 h oftuning, a speedup of $^ { 5 , 1 4 0 \times }$ (classification) and $^ { 3 , 0 0 0 \times }$ (regression).Finally, we demonstrate various foundation model characteristicsof TabPFN, including fine-tuning, generative abilities and densityestimation.

generate a powerful tabular prediction algorithm that is fully learned.Although ICL was first observed in large language models, recentwork has shown that transformers can learn simple algorithmssuch as logistic regression through $\mathsf { I C L } ^ { 1 8 - 2 1 }$ . Prior-data Fitted Net-works (PFNs) have shown that even complex algorithms, such asGaussian Processes and Bayesian Neural Networks, can be approxi-mated with ICL22. ICL enables us to learn a wider space of possiblealgorithms, including cases for which a closed-form solution doesnot exist.

We build on a preliminary version of TabPFN23, which demonstratedthe applicability of in-context-learning17 for tabular data in principlebut had many limitations that rendered it inapplicable in most cases.Based on a series of improvements, the new TabPFN scales to $5 0 \times$ largerdatasets; supports regression tasks, categorical data and missingvalues; and is robust to unimportant features and outliers.

The key idea behind TabPFN is to generate a large corpus of synthetictabular datasets and then train a transformer-based12 neural networkto learn to solve these synthetic prediction tasks. Although traditionalapproaches require hand-engineered solutions for data challengessuch as missing values, our method autonomously learns effectivestrategies by solving synthetic tasks that include these challenges. Thisapproach leverages ICL as a framework for exemplar-based declarativeprogramming of algorithms. We design desired algorithmic behaviourby generating diverse synthetic datasets that demonstrate the desiredbehaviour and then train a model to encode an algorithm that satisfiesit. This shifts the algorithm design process from writing explicit instruc-tions to defining input–output examples, opening up possibilities forcreating algorithms in various domains. Here, we apply this approachto the high-impact field of tabular learning, generating a powerfultabular prediction algorithm.

Our ICL approach differs fundamentally from standard super-vised deep learning. Usually, models are trained per dataset, upd-ating model parameters on individual samples or batches accordingto hand-crafted weight-updating algorithms, such as Adam24.

At inference time, the learned model is applied to test samples. Bycontrast, our approach is trained across datasets and is applied toentire datasets at inference time rather than individual samples. Beforebeing applied to real-world datasets, the model is once pre-trainedon millions of synthetic datasets representing different predictiontasks. At inference time, the model receives an unseen dataset withboth labelled training and unlabelled test samples and performstraining and prediction on this dataset in a single neural networkforward pass.

# Figures 1 and 2 outline our approach:

1. Data generation: we define a generative process (referred to as ourprior) to synthesize diverse tabular datasets with varying relation-ships between features and targets, designed to capture a wide rangeof potential scenarios that our model might encounter. We samplemillions of datasets from the generative process. For each dataset,a subset of samples has their target values masked, simulating asupervised prediction problem. Further details of our prior designare shown in the section ‘Synthetic data based on causal models’.

2. Pre-training: we train a transformer model, our PFN, to predict themasked targets of all synthetic datasets, given the input featuresand the unmasked samples as context. This step is done only onceduring model development, learning a generic learning algorithmthat can be used to predict any dataset.

3. Real-world prediction: the resulting trained model can now beapplied to arbitrary unseen real-world datasets. The training samplesare provided as context to the model, which predicts the labels ofthese unseen datasets through ICL.

Our approach also has a theoretical foundation as described inref. 22. It can be viewed as approximating Bayesian prediction for aprior defined by the synthetic datasets. The trained PFN will approxi-mate the posterior predictive distribution $p ( \hat { \mathbf { y } } _ { \mathrm { t e s t } } | \mathbf { X } _ { \mathrm { t e s t } } , \mathbf { X } _ { \mathrm { t r a i n } } , \mathbf { y } _ { \mathrm { t r a i n } } )$ andthus return a Bayesian prediction for the specified distribution overartificial datasets used during PFN pre-training.

# An architecture designed for tables

The transformer architecture is currently the favoured architecture forflexible deep learning and foundation models4,5 . Transformer modelswork on sequences and combine information between sequence itemsusing so-called attention mechanisms25, allowing them to effectivelycapture long-range dependencies and learn complex relationships indata. Although transformer-based models can be applied to tabulardata26,27, TabPFN addresses two key limitations inherent to them. First,as transformers are designed for sequences, they treat the input dataas a single sequence, not using the tabular structure. Second, machinelearning models are often used in a fit-predict model, in which a modelis fitted on the training set once and then reused for multiple test data-sets. Transformer-based ICL algorithms, however, receive train andtest data in a single pass and thus perform training and prediction atonce. Thus, when a fitted model is reused, it has to redo computationsfor the training set.

To better use the tabular structure, we propose an architecture thatassigns a separate representation to each cell in the table, inspiredby refs. 22,28. Our architecture, visualized in Fig. 1b, uses a two-wayattention mechanism, with each cell attending to the other featuresin its row (that is, its sample) and then attending to the same featureacross its column (that is, all other samples). This design enables thearchitecture to be invariant to the order of both samples and featuresand enables more efficient training and extrapolation to larger tablesthan those encountered during training, in terms of both the numberof samples and features.

To mitigate repeating computations on the training set for each testsample in a fit-predict setting, our model can separate the inferenceon the training and test samples. This allows us to perform ICL on thetraining set once, save the resulting state and reuse it for multiple testset inferences. On datasets with 10,000 training samples and 10 fea-tures, our optimized train-state caching results in inference speedups of

around $3 0 0 \times$ on CPU (from 32 s to 0.1 s) and $_ { 6 \times }$ on GPU. With $1 0 \times$ morefeatures (100), the speedups increase to $8 0 0 \times$ on CPU and $3 0 \times$ speedupon GPU. These measurements focus solely on the core inference pro-cess, excluding pre-processing and ensembling steps detailed in thesection ‘Inference details’. The lower speedups on GPUs are because ofan underutilization of their massively parallel architecture.

We further optimize the memory and compute requirements of thearchitecture by computing layer norms in half-precision, using flashattention29, activation checkpointing and sequential computation ofthe state. Our optimizations reduce the memory requirements by afactor of four, resulting in less than 1,000 bytes per cell. This enablesthe prediction on datasets with up to 50 million cells (for example,5 million rows $\times 1 0$ features) on a single H100 GPU.

For regression tasks, we use a piece-wise constant output distribu-tion, following refs. 22,30, which allows our models to predict a prob-ability distribution of target values instead of a single value, including,for example, bimodal distributions.

# Synthetic data based on causal models

The performance of TabPFN relies on generating suitable synthetictraining datasets that capture the characteristics and challenges ofreal-world tabular data. To generate such datasets, we developed anapproach based on structural causal models (SCMs)31. SCMs provide aformal framework for representing causal relationships and generativeprocesses underlying the data. By relying on synthetic data insteadof large collections of public tabular data, we avoid common prob-lems of foundational models, such as privacy and copyright infringe-ments, contaminating our training data with test data32 or limited dataavailability.

As shown in Fig. 2, our generative pipeline first samples high-levelhyperparameters, such as dataset size, number of features and diffi-culty level, to govern the overall properties of each synthetic dataset.

Fig. 3 | The behaviour of TabPFN and a set of baselines on simple functions.In all plots, we use orange for the ground truth and blue for model predictions.a, Each column represents a different toy function, each having a single feature(along the x-axis) and a target (along the y-axis). TabPFN can model a lot of



different functions, including noisy functions. b, TabPFN can model distributionsover outputs out of the box, which is exemplified by predicting the lightintensity pattern in a double-slit experiment after observing the positions of1,000 photons.


Guided by these hyperparameters, we construct a directed acyclicgraph specifying the causal structure underlying the dataset.

To generate each sample within a dataset, we propagate randomlygenerated noise, called our initialization data, through the root nodesof the causal graph. This initialization data are generated by samplingfrom a random normal or uniform distribution with varying degreesof non-independence between samples, see section ‘Initializationdata sampling’. As these data traverse the edges of the computationalgraph, we apply a diverse set of computational mappings: smallneural networks with linear or nonlinear activations (for example,sigmoid, ReLU (rectified linear unit), modulo, sine), discretizationmechanisms for generating categorical features and decision treestructures to encode local, rule-based dependencies. At each edge,we add Gaussian noise, introducing uncertainty into the generateddata. We save the intermediate data representations at each nodeto be retrieved later. See section ‘Computational edge mappings’for details.

After traversing the causal graph, we extract the intermediate repre-sentations at the sampled feature and target nodes, yielding a sampleconsisting of feature values and an associated target value.

By incorporating various data challenges and complexities into thesynthetic datasets, we create a training ground that allows TabPFN todevelop strategies for handling similar issues in real-world datasets.For instance, consider the case of missing values, commonly presentin tabular data. By exposing TabPFN to synthetic datasets with varyingpatterns and fractions of missing values in our synthetic data genera-tion process, the model learns effective ways of handling missing val-ues that generalize to real-world datasets. We apply post-processingtechniques to further enhance the realism and challenge the robustnessof the learned prediction algorithms. This includes warping with theKumaraswamy distribution33, introducing complex nonlinear distor-tions and quantization mimicking discretized features. See section‘Post-processing’ for details.

Through this generative process, we created a massive corpus ofaround 100 million synthetic datasets per model training, each with aunique causal structure, feature types and functional characteristics.

# Qualitative analysis

We first analyse the behaviour of TabPFN on toy problems to buildintuition and disentangle the impact of various dataset characteristics.As regression problems are easier to visualize, we focus on these in ourqualitative analysis. In Fig. 3a, we compare TabPFN with a diverse set ofstandard predictors, with all methods using default settings.

Linear (ridge) regression can naturally model only linear functions,leading to simple and interpretable predictions but catastrophic failureon many of the toy functions. Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs)34 performworse on datasets with highly non-smooth patterns14. This is especiallyapparent for the step function. TabPFN, by contrast, models eitherfunction type, smooth or non-smooth, out of the box. This includesa good approximation to step functions despite TabPFN being a neu-ral network. CatBoost9 , representative of tree-based methods, fitsonly piece-wise constant functions. Although this leads to approxi-mation errors and unintuitive predictions, it avoids catastrophicfailures.

The main advantage of TabPFN over all baselines is its inherent abil-ity to model uncertainty at no extra cost. Whereas classical regressionmethods output a single real-valued prediction, TabPFN returns a targetdistribution, capturing the uncertainty of predictions. These uncer-tainty modelling abilities of TabPFN extend beyond simple distribu-tions and can handle complex, multi-modal distributions. Figure 3bshows this by modelling the density of light reaching a detector screenin a double-slit experiment35 for different slit distances and widths. Inthis classic experiment, photons are sent through two slits creating amulti-modal intensity pattern because of the wave-like interferencebehaviour of light. TabPFN predicts these intricate patterns in justa single forward pass, requiring only 1.2 s. By contrast, traditionalmethods such as CatBoost require training multiple quantile modelsat different quantiles and reconstructing the distribution from thesepredictions. Even after tuning CatBoost specifically for this task, itproduced substantially worse predictions compared with TabPFN,see Fig. 3b. With default settings, CatBoost requires 169.3 s and yieldsfurther deteriorated results. Qualitatively, we observe that TabPFN is

more accurate in predicting very low densities and has fewer artefactscompared with CatBoost.

# Quantitative analysis

We quantitatively evaluate TabPFN on two dataset collections: theAutoML Benchmark36 and OpenML-CTR2337. These benchmarks com-prise diverse real-world tabular datasets, curated for complexity, rel-evance and domain diversity. From these benchmarks, we use the 29classification datasets and 28 regression datasets that have up to 10,000samples, 500 features and 10 classes. We further evaluated additionalbenchmark suites from refs. 14,15, as well as five Kaggle competitionsfrom the Tabular Playground Series.

We compared TabPFN against state-of-the-art baselines, includingtree-based methods (random forest38, XGBoost (XGB)7 , CatBoost9 ,LightGBM8 ), linear models, support vector machines (SVMs)39 andMLPs34.

Evaluation metrics include ROC AUC (area under the receiver operat-ing characteristic curve; One-vs-Rest) and accuracy for classification,and $R ^ { 2 }$ (coefficient of determination) and negative RMSE (root meansquared error) for regression. Scores were normalized per dataset,with 1.0 representing the best and 0.0 the worst performance withrespect to all baselines.

For each dataset and method, we ran 10 repetitions with different ran-dom seeds and train–test splits $90 \%$ train, $10 \%$ test). We tuned hyper-parameters using random search with five-fold cross-validation, withtime budgets ranging from 30 s to 4 h. All methods were evaluated usingeight CPU cores, with TabPFN additionally using a consumer-grade GPU(RTX 2080 Ti; other methods did not benefit from this, see ExtendedData Fig. 2d). TabPFN was pre-trained once using eight NVIDIA RTX2080 GPUs over 2 weeks, allowing for ICL on all new datasets in a singleforward pass. These modest computational requirements make similarresearch accessible to academic labs. For details, refer to the section‘Detailed evaluation protocol’.

# Comparison with state-of-the-art baselines

Figure 4a demonstrates the strong out-of-the-box performance ofTabPFN compared with tuned and default configurations of XGBoost,CatBoost and a random forest. For classification tasks, TabPFN sur-passes CatBoost, the strongest default baseline, by 0.187 (0.939 com-pared with 0.752) in normalized ROC AUC in the default setting and by0.13 (0.952 compared with 0.822) in the tuned setting. For regression,TabPFN outperforms CatBoost in normalized RMSE by 0.051 (0.923compared with 0.872) in the default setting and by 0.093 (0.968 com-pared with 0.875) in the tuned setting. In Fig. 4b, we show per-datasetcomparisons. Although for some datasets CatBoost outperformsTabPFN, TabPFN wins on most of the datasets.

Figure 4c shows how the performance of TabPFN and the baselinesimprove with more time spent on hyperparameter search. The defaultof TabPFN, taking 2.8 s on average for classification and 4.8 s for regres-sion, outperforms all baselines, even when tuning them for $4 \mathsf { h } { - } \mathsf { a }$speedup of $^ { 5 , 1 4 0 \times }$ and $^ { 3 , 0 0 0 \times }$ , respectively. We show comparisonson a larger number of metrics in Extended Data Tables 1 and 2.

As shown in Extended Data Fig. 2, similar to our primary benchmarks,TabPFN substantially outperformed all baselines on the benchmarks ofrefs. 14,15. The benchmark of ref. 14 is particularly noteworthy becauseon this benchmark, tree-based methods were previously found to excel.Moreover, we show in Extended Data Table 6 that default TabPFNoutperforms default CatBoost on all five Kaggle competitions withless than 10,000 training samples from the latest completed TabularPlayground Series.

# Evaluating diverse data attributes

In Fig. 5a,b, we show the robustness of TabPFN to dataset character-istics that are traditionally hard to handle for neural-network-basedapproaches14,23.

Figure 5a provides an analysis of the performance of TabPFN acrossvarious dataset types. First, we add uninformative features (randomly

Fig. 5 | Robustness across datasets and performance comparison withtuned ensembles. a, A comparison of modified datasets. We can see thatTabPFN is not more vulnerable to the modifications compared with baselines.We also see that TabPFN reproduces the accuracy of CatBoost (default) withonly half the training samples provided. Here we normalize scores per dataset(sharing one normalization across all modifications of one experiment) toavoid negative outliers. b, We split the test datasets by data characteristics and


shuffled features from the original dataset) and outliers (multiply eachcell with $2 \%$ probability with a random number between 0 and the out-lier factor). The results show that TabPFN is very robust to uninforma-tive features and outliers, something typically hard for neural networks,as can be seen with the MLP baseline. Second, although dropping eithersamples or features hurts the performance of all methods, with halfthe samples TabPFN still performs as well as the next best methodusing all samples.

In Fig. 5b, we split our test datasets into subgroups and performanalyses per subgroup. We create subgroups based on the presence ofcategorical features, missing values, number of samples and number offeatures in the datasets. The sample- and feature-number subgroupsare split such that a third of the datasets fall into each group. We cansee that none of these characteristics strongly affect the performanceof TabPFN relative to the other methods. However, we note that theseresults should not be taken as evidence that TabPFN scales well beyondthe 10,000 samples and 500 features considered here. We show fourfurther ablations in Extended Data Fig. 1.

# Comparison with tuned ensemble methods

We compare the performance of TabPFN with AutoGluon 1.0 (ref. 40),which combines various machine learning models, including our base-lines, into a stacked ensemble41, tunes their hyperparameters and thengenerates the final predictions using post hoc ensembling (PHE)42,43. Itthus represents a different class of methods compared with individualbaselines.

To assess whether TabPFN can also be improved by a tuned ensembleapproach, we introduce TabPFN (PHE). TabPFN (PHE) automaticallycombines only TabPFN models with PHE and tunes their hyperparam-eters using a random portfolio from our search space. We detail thisapproach in the section ‘TabPFN (PHE)’.

Figure 5c–d compares the performance of TabPFN, TabPFN (PHE),AutoGluon and CatBoost. For TabPFN (PHE) and AutoGluon, we startwith a minimal budget of 300 s for tuning because AutoGluon oth-erwise does not reliably return results. In just 2.8 s, TabPFN (default)outperforms AutoGluon for classification tasks, even if AutoGluon isallowed up to 4 h, a $5 . 1 4 0 \times$ speedup. TabPFN (PHE) further improvesperformance leading to an average normalized ROC AUC score of 0.971,compared with 0.939 for TabPFN (default) and 0.914 for AutoGluon.For regression tasks, tuning hyperparameters is more important. Here,TabPFN (PHE) outperforms AutoGluon (allowed 4 h) after its minimaltuning budget of 300 s, a $4 8 \times$ speedup.

# Foundation model with interpretability

Apart from its strong predictive performance, TabPFN exhibits keyfoundation model abilities, such as data generation, density estima-tion, learning reusable embeddings and fine-tuning. We showcasethese abilities through proof-of-concept experiments on the Ger-man Credit Dataset44, which contains credit risk information and themfeat-factors45 dataset classifying handwritten digits based on a tabularrepresentation.

TabPFN can estimate the probability density function of numericalfeatures, as shown in Fig. 6a, and the probability mass function of cat-egorical features. Computing the sample densities enables anomalydetection to identify issues such as fraud, equipment failures, medicalemergencies or low-quality data.

TabPFN also allows synthesizing new tabular data samples that mimicreal-world dataset characteristics as shown in Fig. 6b. This enables appli-cations such as data augmentation or privacy-preserving data sharing46.

The architecture of TabPFN yields meaningful feature repre-sentations that can be reused for downstream tasks such as data

imputation and clustering. We extract and visualize learned embed-dings from the mfeat-factors dataset in Fig. 6c, showing improvedclass separation compared with the raw data on the first two principalcomponents.

Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of TabPFN to improve per-formance through fine-tuning on related datasets. Unlike tree-basedmethods, the neural architecture of TabPFN enables fine-tuning onspecific dataset classes. We conduct proof-of-concept experimentsusing sine curve datasets with varying offsets between fine-tuning andtest data. Figure 6d shows an example fine-tuning result. Our analysisacross 50 runs (Extended Data Fig. 4) shows that TabPFN successfullytransfers knowledge even when labels differ significantly betweenfine-tuning and test tasks, with performance improving as distributionsbecome more similar. This could, for example, enable fine-tuning for arange of datasets from medical studies to obtain an improved generalmodel for medical diagnosis tasks. For details, refer to section ‘Founda-tion model abilities’.

Finally, we have developed a methodology to easily interpret thepredictions of TabPFN. Interpretability is crucial for building trustand accountability when deploying models in high-stakes domains.We support the computation of feature importance through SHAP47(Shapley Additive Explanations), a game-theoretic approach toexplain predictions. SHAP values represent the contribution of eachfeature to the output of the model. Extended Data Fig. 3 comparesthe feature importance and impact for logistic regression, CatBoostand TabPFN. TabPFN achieves high accuracy while learning simple,interpretable feature relationships. By contrast, logistic regression isinterpretable but less accurate, whereas CatBoost is accurate but quali-tatively less interpretable because of complex, non-smooth decisionboundaries.

# Conclusion

TabPFN represents a major change in tabular data modelling, lever-aging ICL to autonomously discover a highly efficient algorithm thatoutperforms traditional human-designed approaches on datasets withup to 10,000 samples and 500 features. This shift towards foundationmodels trained on synthetic data opens up new possibilities for tabulardata analysis across various domains.

Potential future directions include scaling to larger datasets48,handling data drift49, investigating fine-tuning abilities across relatedtabular tasks50 and understanding the theoretical foundations of ourapproach51. Future work could also explore creating specialized priorsto handle data types such as time series52 and multi-modal data, orspecialized modalities such as ECG, neuroimaging data53 and geneticdata. As the field of tabular data modelling continues to evolve, we

# User guide

When to use TabPFN. TabPFN excels in handling small- to medium-sizeddatasets with up to 10,000 samples and 500 features (Fig. 4 and ExtendedData Table 1). For larger datasets and highly non-smooth regressiondatasets, approaches such as CatBoost9 , XGB7 or AutoGluon40 are likelyto outperform TabPFN.

Although TabPFN provides a powerful drop-in replacement for tra-ditional tabular data models such as CatBoost, similar to these mod-els, it is intended to be only one component in the toolkit of a datascientist. Achieving top performance on real-world problems oftenrequires domain expertise and the ingenuity of data scientists. As forother modelling approaches, data scientists should continue to applytheir skills and insights in feature engineering, data cleaning and prob-lem framing to get the most out of TabPFN. We hope that the train-ing speed of TabPFN will facilitate faster iterations in the data scienceworkflow.

Limitations of TabPFN. The limitations of TabPFN are as follows:(1) the inference speed of TabPFN may be slower than highly optimizedapproaches such as CatBoost; (2) the memory usage of TabPFN scaleslinearly with dataset size, which can be prohibitive for very large data-sets; and (3) our evaluation focused on datasets with up to 10,000samples and 500 features; scalability to larger datasets requires furtherstudy.

Computational and time requirements. TabPFN is computation-ally efficient and can run on consumer hardware for most datasets.However, training on a new dataset is recommended to run on a (con-sumer) GPU as this speeds it up by one to three orders of magnitude.Although TabPFN is very fast to train, it is not optimized for real-timeinference tasks. For a dataset with 10,000 rows and 10 columns, ourmodel requires 0.2 s (0.6 s without GPU) to perform a prediction forone sample, whereas CatBoost (default) can do the same in 0.0002 s.In ref. 55, further optimizing TabPFN specifically for inference taskshas already been explored, resulting in four times faster inferenceperformance compared with even XGBoost, but so far also reducingpredictive quality. Refer to the section ‘Details on the neural archi-tecture’ for details on the memory usage and runtime complexity ofTabPFN.

Data preparation. TabPFN can handle raw data with minimal pre-processing. If we simply provide the data in a tabular format (NumPymatrix), TabPFN will automatically handle missing values, encodecategorical variables and normalize features. Although TabPFNworks well out of the box, we can further improve the performanceusing dataset-specific pre-processing. This can also be partly doneautomatically with our PHE technique or manually by modifying thedefault settings. When manually pre-processing data, we should keepin mind that the neural network of TabPFN expects roughly normallydistributed features and targets after all pre-processing steps. If we,for example, know that a feature follows a log distribution, it mighthelp to exponentiate it before feeding it to TabPFN. As TabPFN does$z$ -normalization of all inputs, scaling does not affect the predictions.As for all algorithms, however, using domain knowledge to combineor remove features can increase performance.

Hyperparameter tuning. TabPFN provides strong performance outof the box without extensive hyperparameter tuning (see section‘Comparison with state-of-the-art baselines’). If we have additionalcomputational resources, we can further optimize the performanceof TabPFN using hyperparameter optimization (HPO) or the PHE tech-nique described in the section ‘TabPFN (PHE)’. Our implementationdirectly provides HPO with random search and PHE.

# Details on the neural architecture

Our architecture is a variation of the original transformer encoder12and the original PFN architecture22, but it treats each cell in the tableas a separate time position, similar to that in ref. 28. Therefore, it cangeneralize to more training samples as well as features than seen dur-ing training.

Figure 1b details our new architecture. All features that go into ourarchitecture are first mapped to floating point values, that is, cate-goricals are transformed to integers. These values are subjected to$z$ -normalization using the mean and standard deviation for each fea-ture separately across the whole training set. These values are nowencoded with simple linear encoders. Each layer first has an attentionover features, followed by an attention over samples, both of whichoperate separately on each column or row, respectively. These twosub-layers are followed by an MLP sublayer. Each sublayer is followedby a residual addition and a half-precision layer norm.

We found that encoding groups of features can be even more effec-tive compared with encoding one value per representation. For ourhyperparameter search space, we selected six architectures for clas-sification and five for regression. In three of the six classification modelsand four of the five regression models, including the TabPFN default, atransformer position encodes two features of one example; in others,it represents one value.

Although the inter-feature attention is a classical fully connectedattention, our inter-sample attention does not allow the test samplesto attend to each other but only to the training data. Therefore, wemake sure that the test samples do not influence each other or the train-ing set representations. To allow our model to differentiate featuresmore easily that have the same statistics, for example, two features thathave the same entries just in different orders, we use random featureembeddings that we add to all embeddings before the first layer. Wegenerate one embedding per feature by projecting a random vector ofone-fourth the size of our embeddings through a learned linear layerand add this to all embeddings representing an instance of that feature.

As the representations of training samples are not influenced by thetest set, we cache the keys and values of the training samples to allowsplitting training and inference. We use a special variant of multi-queryattention for our inter-sample attention from test samples56 to savememory when caching representations. In our variant, we use all keysand values for the attention between samples of the training set, butrepeatedly use the first key and value for attention from the test sam-ples. This allows caching only one key or value vector pair per cell inthe training set that is fed into our inter-sample attention of new testsamples.

The compute requirements of this architecture scale quadraticallywith the number of samples (n) and the number of features $( m )$ , that is$O ( n ^ { 2 } + m ^ { 2 } )$ , and the memory requirements scale linearly in the datasetsize, $O ( n \cdot m )$ .

Finally, we found that pre-processing inputs can help performance,thus we can perform z-normalization of all inputs across the sampledimension and add an extra input for each cell that indicates whetherthe input was missing; the input itself is set to 0 in these cases. Allinputs are finally linearly encoded into the embedding dimensionof TabPFN.

# Details on the causal generative process

An SCM $\mathcal { G } { : = } \left( Z , \epsilon \right)$ consists of a collection $\boldsymbol { Z } { : = } \left( z _ { 1 } , . . . , z _ { k } \right)$ of structuralassignments (called mechanisms): $z _ { i } = f _ { i } \left( z _ { \mathrm { P A } \mathcal { G } ( i ) } , \epsilon _ { i } \right)$ ,  where PA $\mathcal { G } ( i )$ is theset of parents of node i (its direct causes) in the underlying directedacyclic graph (DAG) $\mathcal { G }$ (the causal graph) $\mathbf { \Delta } , f _ { i }$ is a (potentially nonlinear)deterministic function and $\epsilon _ { i }$ is a noise variable. Causal relationshipsin $\mathcal { G }$ are represented by edges pointing from causes to effects31. Asour prior is a sampling procedure, we can make a lot of choices on,for example, the graph size or complexity. By defining a probability

# Article

distribution over these hyperparameters in the prior, the posteriorpredictive distribution approximated by TabPFN at inference timeimplicitly represents a Bayesian ensemble, jointly integrating over aweighted hyperparameter space. The specific hyperparameter rangesand sampling strategies are chosen to cover a diverse set of scenariosthat we expect to encounter in real-world tabular data.

Graph structure sampling. The structural causal models underlyingeach dataset are based on a DAG G. We sample these graphs using thegrowing network with redirection sampling method57, a preferentialattachment process that generates random scale-free networks. Weeither sample a single connected component or merge multiple disjointsubgraphs. Disjoint subgraphs lead to features that are marginallyindependent of the target if they are not connected to the target node,reflecting real-world scenarios with uninformative predictors.

To control the complexity of the sampled DAGs, we use two hyper-parameters: the number of nodes N and the redirection probability P.N is sampled from a log-uniform distribution, logN ~ $\boldsymbol { \mathcal { U } } ( \boldsymbol { a } , \boldsymbol { b } )$ , where aand $^ b$ are hyperparameters controlling the range of the graph size. Theredirection probability $P$ is sampled from a gamma distribution,$P \sim \Gamma ( \alpha , \beta )$ , where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are shape and rate parameters, respectively.Larger values of N yield graphs with more nodes, whereas smaller val-ues of $P$ lead to denser graphs with more edges on average57.

Computational edge mappings. In our implementation, each SCMnode and sample is represented as a vector in $\mathbb { R } ^ { d }$ . When propagatingdata through the SCM, the deterministic functions fi at each edge mapthe input vectors to an output vector using four types of computa-tional modules:

1. Small neural networks: here we initialize weight matrices $W \in \mathbb { R } ^ { d \times d }$using Xavier initialization58 and apply a linear transformation $W x + b$to the input vectors $x \in \mathbb { R } ^ { d }$ , where $\dot { b } \in \mathbb { R } ^ { d }$ is a bias vector. After thelinear projection, we apply element-wise nonlinear activation func-tions $\mathcal { \bar { O } } : \bar { \mathbb { R } ^ { d } } \to \mathbb { R } ^ { d }$ , randomly sampled from a set, including identity,logarithm, sigmoid, absolute value, sine, hyperbolic tangent, rankoperation, squaring, power functions, smooth ReLU59, step functionand modulo operation.

2. Categorical feature discretization: to generate categorical featuresfrom the numerical vectors at each node, we map the vector to theindex of the nearest neighbour in a set of per node randomly sampledvectors $\{ p _ { 1 } , . . . , p _ { K } \}$ for a feature with K categories. This discrete indexwill be observed in the feature set as a categorical feature. We samplethe number of categories K from a rounded gamma distribution withan offset of 2 to yield a minimum number of classes of 2. To furtheruse these discrete class assignments in the computational graph,they need to be embedded as continuous values. We sample a secondset of embedding vectors $\{ p _ { 1 } ^ { \prime } , . . . , p _ { K } ^ { \prime } \}$ for each class and transformthe classes to these embeddings.

3. Decision trees: to incorporate structured, rule-based dependencies,we implement decision trees in the SCMs. At certain edges, we selecta subset of features and apply decision boundaries on their valuesto determine the output60. The decision tree parameters (featuresplits, thresholds) are randomly sampled per edge.

4. Noise injection: at each edge, we add random normal noise from thenormal distribution ${ \mathcal { N } } ( 0 , \sigma ^ { 2 } I )$ .

Initialization data sampling. For each to-be-generated sample, werandomly generate initialization data ϵ that is inserted at the DAG rootnodes and then propagated through the computational graph. Thenoise variables $\epsilon$ are generated according to one of three samplingmechanisms:

1. Normal: ϵ ~ $\mathcal { N } ( 0 , \sigma _ { \epsilon } ^ { 2 } )$ , where $\sigma _ { \epsilon } ^ { 2 }$ is a hyperparameter.

2. Uniform: $\epsilon \sim \mathcal { U } ( - a , a )$ , where $^ { a }$ is a hyperparameter.

3. Mixed: for each root node, we randomly select either a normal oruniform distribution to sample the initialization noise ϵ from.

Furthermore, we sample input data with varying degrees of non-independence for some datasets. Here we first sample a random frac-tion $\rho$ of samples to serve as prototypes $x _ { 1 } ^ { * } , . . . , x _ { M } ^ { * }$ , where $M { = } \rho n$ and nis the dataset size. Then, for each input vector $x _ { i }$ to be sampled, weassign weights $\alpha _ { i j }$ to the prototypes and linearly mix the final input as

$$
x _ {i} = \sum_ {j = 1} ^ {M} \alpha_ {i j} x _ {j} ^ {*}, \tag {1}
$$

where $\textstyle \sum _ { j } { \alpha _ { i j } } = 1 .$ . The weights $\alpha _ { i j }$ are sampled from a multinomial distri-bution, $\alpha _ { i }$ ~ Multinomial $( \beta )$ , where $\beta$ is a temperature hyperparametercontrolling the degree of non-independence: larger $\beta$ yields more uni-form weights, whereas smaller $\beta$ concentrates the weights on fewerprototypes per sample.

Post-processing. Each dataset is post-processed randomly with oneor more of the following post-processings: (1) For some datasets, weuse the Kumaraswamy feature warping, introducing nonlinear distor-tions33 to features as done in ref. 61. (2) We quantize some continuousfeatures into buckets of randomly sampled cardinality K, mimick-ing binned or discretized features commonly encountered in data-sets. We map a feature value x to the index of the bucket it falls into,determined by $K + 1$ bin edges sampled from the set of values this fea-ture takes. (3) To introduce scenarios for dynamic imputation andhandling of incomplete datasets, a common challenge in data sci-ence, we randomly designate a fraction $\rho _ { \mathrm { m i s s } }$ of the data as missing ac-cording to the missing completely at random strategy. Each value ismasked as missing with probability $\rho _ { \mathrm { m i s s . } }$ , independently of the datavalues.

Target generation. To generate target labels for regression tasks, weselect a randomly chosen continuous feature without post-processing.For classification labels, we select a random categorical featurethat contains up to 10 classes. Thus, natively our method is limitedto predicting at most 10 classes. This number can be increased bypre-training on datasets with a larger number of classes or by usingapproaches such as building a one-vs-one classifier, one-vs-rest clas-sifier or building on approaches such as error-correcting output codes$( \mathsf { E C O C } ) ^ { 6 2 }$ .

# Training details

The training loss of any PFN is the cross-entropy between the tar-gets of held-out samples of synthetic datasets and the model pre-diction. For a test set $( { \bf X } _ { \mathrm { t e s t } } , { \bf y } _ { \mathrm { t e s t } } ) = D _ { \mathrm { t e s t } } ,$ the training loss is given by$\begin{array} { r } { \mathcal { L } _ { \mathtt { P F N } } = \mathbf { E } _ { ( ( X _ { \mathrm { t e s t } } , y _ { \mathrm { t e s t } } ) \cup D _ { \mathrm { t r a i n } } ) \sim p ( D ) } \big [ - \log q _ { \theta } ( y _ { \mathrm { t e s t } } | X _ { \mathrm { t e s t } } , D _ { \mathrm { t r a i n } } ) \big ] } \end{array}$ . By minimizingthis loss, the PFN learns to approximate the true Bayesian posteriorpredictive distribution for a chosen prior over datasets (and potentiallytheir latent variables) D, as shown in ref. 22.

We trained our final models for approximately 2,000,000 steps witha batch size of 64 datasets. That means the models used for TabPFNare trained on around 130,000,000 synthetically generated datasetseach. One training run requires around 2 weeks on one node with eightNvidia RTX 2080 Ti GPUs. We sample the number of training samplesfor each dataset uniformly up to 2,048 and use a fixed validation setsize of 128. We sample the number of features using a beta distribution$k = 0 . 9 5$ , $\pmb { b = 8 . 0 }$ ) that we linearly scale to the range 1–160. To avoidpeaks in memory usage, the total size of each table was restricted tobe below 75,000 cells by decreasing the number of samples for largenumbers of features.

We chose the hyperparameters for the prior based on randomsearches, in which we use only a single GPU per training and evaluateon our development set, see section ‘Quantitative analysis’. We usedthe Adam optimizer24 with linear warmup and cosine annealing63 andtested a set of learning rates in [0.0001, 0.0005], using the one withthe lowest final training loss.

# Inference details

To get the most performance out of TabPFN, it is crucial to optimizeits inference pipeline. We generally always apply TabPFN in a smallensemble, in which we perform pre-processing or post-processing ofthe data differently for each ensemble member.

As our models are not fully permutation invariant, for each ensemblemember, we shuffle the feature order, approximating order invari-ance64. For classification tasks, we additionally randomly permute thelabels. We also apply a temperature to the softmax distribution of ourmodel outputs for calibration.

Apart from the above, we use a subset of the following for each ofour default ensemble members:

1. Quantile + Id: we quantize the inputs to equally spaced values bet-ween 0 and 1, but keep a copy of each original feature. This effectivelydoubles the number of features passed to TabPFN.

2. Category shuffling: the labels of categorical features with low cardi-nality are shuffled.

3. SVD: an SVD compression of the features is appended to the features.

4. Outlier removal: all outliers, more than 12 standard deviations fromthe mean, are removed.

5. Power transform: each feature (or the label for regression) is trans-formed using a Yeo–Johnson transformation to stabilize the varianceand make the data more normally distributed.

6. One-hot encoding: categorical features are encoded using one-hotencoding, in which each category is represented as a binary vector.

For PHE and hyperparameter tuning of TabPFN, we use a larger set ofpre-processing techniques that additionally include a logarithmic, anexponential and a KDI transformation65. These transformations helpaddress nonlinear relationships, skewed distributions and varyingscales among features.

To calibrate prediction uncertainty, we apply a softmax temperature(default $T = 0 . 9$ ) by dividing logits before the softmax calculation:

$$
P \left(y _ {i} \mid x\right) = \frac {\exp \left(z _ {i} / T\right)}{\sum_ {j} \exp \left(z _ {j} / T\right)}, \tag {2}
$$

where $z _ { i }$ are the logits, T is the temperature and $P ( y _ { i } | x )$ is the calibratedprobability. We offer the option to generate second-order polynomialfeatures by multiplying up to 50 randomly selected feature pairs:

$$
f _ {i j} = x _ {i} \cdot x _ {j}, \quad \text {f o r} (i, j) \in \mathcal {S}, \tag {3}
$$

where $s$ is the set of randomly chosen feature pairs. This can capturenonlinear interactions between features. This option is disabled bydefault. To ensure proper handling of duplicate samples given thesample permutation invariance of our architecture, we add a uniquesample identifier feature. This is a random number drawn from a stand-ard normal distribution, ensuring each sample is treated distinctly inthe attention mechanism. We also provide an option for subsamplingin each estimator, to increase ensemble diversity, which performs ran-dom sampling without replacement. This option is disabled by default.

Regression details. To enable our model to do classification on a largerange of scales and target distributions, we use the following approach.During pre-training, we rescale our regression targets to have zeromean and a standard deviation of 1 (z-score). To decide where the bor-ders between our features lie, we draw a large sample of datasets fromour prior and choose the 1/5,000 quantiles from this distribution. Atinference time, we bring the real-world data to a similar range by againapplying z-score normalization. Furthermore, we allow applying arange of transforms, including a power transform as part of our default.All of the transforms, including the z-score are inverted at predictiontime by applying the inverse of the transform to the borders between

buckets. This is equivalent to applying the inverse of the transform tothe random variable represented by our output distribution but forthe half-normals used on the sides for full support22. This is because alltransforms are strictly monotone and the borders represent positionson the cumulative distribution function.

Data grouping based on random forest. To perform well on very het-erogeneous datasets, we also propose to use random trees to split thetraining data into smaller more homogeneous datasets. This techniqueis used only when performing HPO or PHE for TabPFN. It is especiallyuseful for TabPFN as our model performs best on small datasets.

The pre-processing for a single ensemble member, that is, a singletree, works as follows: we use a standard random tree with feature andsample bootstrapping and Gini impurity loss. For each leaf node of thedecision tree, we store the subset of training samples that fall into thatnode and train a TabPFN on these. To predict the class label for a testsample x, we determine the TabPFN to use by passing x through thedecision tree. We set the minimal leaf size to be large (500–2,000) suchthat the resulting data groups are large enough to train a strong model.

# TabPFN (PHE)

To further enhance the inference performance of TabPFN, in TabPFN(PHE), we use PHE for a fixed portfolio of TabPFN configurations fromour search space detailed in Extended Data Table 5. For TabPFN (PHE),we first use holdout validation to sequentially evaluate models fromthe portfolio until a time limit is reached. After all models are evaluatedonce, we repeat holdout validation with new data splits until the timelimit is reached. Then, we ensemble all evaluated TabPFN models byaggregating their predictions with a weighted arithmetic mean. Welearn the weights using greedy ensemble selection (GES)42,66 with 25iterations on prediction data from holdout validation. Finally, we pruneeach zero-weighted model, refit all remaining models on all data andreturn the weighted average of their predictions.

Following standard practice in AutoML, we use GES because its pre-dictive performance is often superior to the best individual model43,67–69.Owing to its ICL, we expect TabPFN to overfit the training data lessthan predictions of traditionally trained algorithms; thus, we opt for(repeated) holdout validation (as in Auto-Sklearn 1; ref. 67) instead of(repeated) cross-validation (as in AutoGluon40). Moreover, as GES usu-ally produces sparse weight vectors43,69, we expect the final ensembleafter pruning each zero-weighted model to consist of a smaller numberof models than for other ensembling approaches, such as bagging. Con-sequently, PHE can also improve the inference efficiency of a TabPFNensemble compared with other ensembling approaches.

# Foundation model abilities

Density estimation. The combination of a regression and a classifica-tion TabPFN can be used as a generative model for tabular data, notonly modelling targets but features as well. Let $\mathcal { D } = \{ ( \mathbf { x } _ { i } , y _ { i } ) \} _ { i = 1 } ^ { N }$ denotethe original dataset, where $\boldsymbol { \mathbf { x } } _ { i } \in \mathbb { R } ^ { d }$ is a $^ d$ -dimensional feature vectorand $y _ { i }$ is the corresponding target value, and let $q _ { \theta }$ represent our trainedTabPFN model, either a regression or classification model dependingon the target type. We aim to approximate the joint distribution of anew example and its label $p ( \mathbf { x } , \mathbf { y } | \mathcal { D } )$ . To do this, we factorize the jointdistribution as

$$
\begin{array}{l} p (\mathbf {x}, y | \mathcal {D}) = \prod_ {j = 1} ^ {d} p \left(x _ {j} \mid \mathbf {x} _ {<   j}, \mathcal {D}\right) \cdot p (y \mid \mathbf {x}, \mathcal {D}) (4) \\ \approx \prod_ {j = 1} ^ {d} q _ {\theta} \left(x _ {j} \mid \boldsymbol {x} _ {<   j}, \mathcal {D} _ {:, <   j}\right) \cdot q _ {\theta} (y | \boldsymbol {x}, \mathcal {D}), (5) \\ \end{array}
$$

where we only condition on a subset of the features in the training set$( \mathcal { D } _ { : , < j } )$ . The feature order of the joint density factorization influences

# Article

the estimated densities. To reduce variance from this source, we applya permutation sampling approximation of Janossy Pooling at inferencetime, in which we average the outputs of Nj feature permutations, with$N _ { j } { = } 2 4$ in our experiments64.

As we cannot condition on an empty feature set for technical reasons,we condition the prediction of the first feature $x _ { 1 } ,$ , on a feature withrandom noise, that is, no information.

The above factorization of the density of a sample (equation (5)) iscompletely tractable and we thus use it to estimate the likelihood fordata points. This enables tasks such as anomaly detection and outlieridentification.

Synthetic data generation. We can leverage the generative abilitiesof TabPFN (see section ‘Density estimation’) to synthesize new tabu-lar data samples that mimic the characteristics of a given real-worlddataset, by simply following the factorization in equation (5) andsampling each feature step by step. The generated synthetic samples$( \mathbf { x } ^ { * } , y ^ { * } )$ can be used for various purposes, such as data augmentation,privacy-preserving data sharing and scenario simulation.

Embeddings. TabPFN can be used to retrieve meaningful feature rep-resentations or embeddings. Given a dataset $\mathcal { D } = \{ ( \mathbf { x } _ { i } , y _ { i } ) \} _ { i = 1 } ^ { N } ,$ the goalis to learn a mapping $f _ { \theta } : \mathbb { R } ^ { d } \xrightarrow { } \mathbb { R } ^ { k }$ that transforms the original$d \cdot$ -dimensional feature vectors $\mathbf { x } _ { i }$ into an embedding space of dimen-sion $k$ . The resulting embeddings $f _ { \theta } ( \mathbf { x } _ { i } ) \in \mathbb { R } ^ { k }$ capture the learnedrelationships between features and can be used for downstream tasks.To use TabPFN for this problem, we simply use the target-columnrepresentations of its final layer as embeddings.

# Detailed evaluation protocol

To rigorously assess the performance and robustness of TabPFN, weconduct a comprehensive quantitative evaluation on standard tabulardataset benchmarks, comparing against state-of-the-art baselinesunder a standardized protocol.

Default configuration of TabPFN. Unlike traditional algorithms,in-context-learned algorithms do not have hyperparameters thatdirectly control their training procedure. Instead, hyperparametersfor inference of TabPFN only control the pre-processing of data andpost-processing of predictions (for example, feature scaling or softmaxtemperature). Our default configuration (TabPFN (default)) for bothclassification and regression is optimized for accurate predictions withminimal fitting time. Here, we apply the same model multiple timeswith different pre- and post-processors and take the average over thepredictions, yielding a four-way (eight-way for regression) ensemble.The settings for our data processing were obtained through a hyper-parameter search optimized on our development datasets. The exactsettings chosen are listed in Extended Data Table 5. We emphasize that,as for other foundation models (such as GPT), we trained our TabPFNmodel once and used the same model to perform ICL in a forward passon all new datasets.

Baselines. We compare with tree-based methods, such as randomforests38, XGBoost7 , CatBoost9 and LightGBM8 , the state of the art forexperts to perform predictions on tabular data14,15. We also comparewith simpler methods, such as ridge regression70, logistic regressionand SVMs39. Although standard neural networks, which unlike TabPFNdo not use ICL, were shown to underperform for small (<10,000 sam-ples) tabular data1,14,71, as a point of reference, we still consider a simpleneural network, the MLP.

Tabular dataset benchmarks. We perform our analysis on two widelyused and publicly available benchmark suites: the standard AutoMLbenchmark36 and the recent regression benchmark OpenML-CTR23(ref. 37). Both benchmarks comprise a diverse set of real-world tabular

datasets, carefully curated to be representative of various domains anddata characteristics. The authors of the benchmark suite selected thesedatasets based on criteria such as sufficient complexity, real-worldrelevance, absence of free-form text features and diversity of problemdomains.

For our quantitative analysis of TabPFN for classification tasks, weuse a set of test datasets comprising all 29 datasets from the AutoMLbenchmark with up to 10,000 samples, 500 features and 10 classes.For regression tasks, the AutoML benchmark contains only 16 data-sets matching these constraints. To increase statistical power, weaugmented this set with all datasets matching our constraints fromthe recent OpenML-CTR23 benchmark, yielding a test set of 28 uniqueregression datasets in total. Extended Data Tables 3 and 4 providefull details for our test sets of classification and regression datasets,respectively.

We further evaluated additional benchmark suites from refs. 14,15.In ref. 14, there are 22 tabular classification datasets selected based oncriteria such as heterogeneous columns, moderate dimensionality andsufficient difficulty. In ref. 15, there is a collection of 176 classificationdatasets, representing one of the largest tabular data benchmarks.However, the curation process for these datasets may not be as rigorousor quality controlled as for AutoML Benchmark and OpenML-CTR23. Wealso evaluated five Kaggle competitions with less than 10,000 trainingsamples from the latest completed Tabular Playground Series.

Development datasets. To decide on the hyperparameters of TabPFN,as well as our hyperparameter search spaces, we considered another setof datasets, our development datasets. We carefully selected datasetsto be non-overlapping with our test datasets described above. Thelist of development datasets can be found in Supplementary Tables 5and 6. We considered the mean of normalized scores (ROC/RMSE)and rank quantiles and chose the best model configurations on thesedevelopment datasets.

Metrics and cross-validation. To obtain scores for classification tasks,we use two widely adopted evaluation metrics: ROC AUC (One-vs-Rest)and accuracy. ROC AUC averages performance over different sensi-tivity–specificity trade-offs, and accuracy measures the fraction ofsamples labelled correctly.

For regression tasks, we use $R ^ { 2 }$ and negative RMSE as evaluation met-rics. $R ^ { 2 }$ represents the proportion of variance in the target columnthat the model can predict. RMSE is the root of the average squaredmagnitude of the errors between the predicted and actual values. Aswe use negative RMSE, for all our four metrics higher values indicatea better fit.

To increase statistical validity, for each dataset and method in ourtest datasets, we evaluated 10 repetitions, each with a different randomseed and train–test split $90 \%$ train and $10 \%$ test samples; all methodsused the same cross-validation splits, defined by OpenML72). We averagethe scores of all repetitions per dataset. Then, to average scores acrossdatasets, we normalize per dataset following previous benchmarks36,40.The absolute scores are linearly scaled such that a score of 1.0 corre-sponds to the highest value achieved by any method on that dataset,whereas a score of 0 represents the lowest result. This normalizationallows for building meaningful averages across datasets with very dif-ferent score ranges. We provide absolute performance numbers inSupplementary Data Tables 1–2. All confidence intervals shown are$9 5 \%$ confidence intervals.

We tuned all methods with a random search using five-fold cross-validation with ROC AUC/RMSE up to a given time budget, ranging fromhalf a minute to 4 h. The first candidate in the random search was thedefault setting supplied in the implementation of the method and wasalso used if not a single cross-validation run finished before the timebudget was consumed. See the section ‘Qualitative analysis’ for the usedsearch spaces per method. All methods were evaluated using 8 CPU

cores. Moreover, TabPFN makes use of a 5-year-old consumer-gradeGPU (RTX 2080 Ti). We also tested GPU acceleration for the baselines.However, as Extended Data Fig. 2 shows, this did not improve perfor-mance, probably because of the small dataset sizes.

# Data availability

All datasets evaluated are publicly available on openml.org or kaggle.com. We have provided scripts in our code repository that automatethe process of downloading and evaluating the datasets. These scriptscontain dataset identifiers, as well as exact data splitting and processingprocedures.

# Code availability

Our code is available at https://priorlabs.ai/tabpfn-nature/ (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13981285). We also provide an API that allowsusers to run TabPFN with minimal coding experience or without theavailability of specific computing hardware such as a GPU. The codeis designed to be modular and easily installable in a standard Pythonenvironment. The code to generate synthetic pre-training data hasnot been released with our models. We aim to enable researchers andpractitioners to easily integrate TabPFN into their workflows and applyit to their specific tabular data tasks. We encourage users to providefeedback, report issues, and contribute to the further development ofTabPFN. This open release aims to facilitate collaboration and acceler-ate the adoption and advancement of TabPFN in various research andapplication domains.

Extended Data Fig. 3 | Comparing SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)summary plots between TabPFN and baselines. We compare SHAP featureimportance and impact for Logistic Regression, TabPFN, and CatBoost on the“Default of Credit Card Clients” dataset. The top features visualized are creditamount, age, and duration. Each point represents a single instance, with thecolor indicating the value of the checking status feature (blue for low, red forhigh), illustrating its interaction with the respective feature on the x-axis.



We see that Logistic Regression is most interpretable due to the simple underlyingfunctions. However, Logistic Regression has poor predictive accuracy, and thelearned functions are unintuitive when looking at the outer bounds of features.TabPFN has good predictive accuracy and learns simple, interpretable functions.CatBoost is the least interpretable, with unclear patterns and wide variation inSHAP values per sample. This figure is adapted from Lundberg et al.47.

Performance of default CatBoost and default TabPFN on all 5 Kaggle classification or regression competitions from the Tabular Playground Series Season 3 with late submission enabled, fewerthan 10,000 rows of data, 500 features, and 10 classes. We report the private score averaged over 5 seeds. For Episode 5, as ordinal regression can be treated as a classification or regressiontask, for both CatBoost and TabPFN we tried both the regression and the classification model and chose the better of the two (regression for CatBoost; classification for TabPFN). Arrows indicatethe optimization direction for each metric. We emphasize that these results only compare Catboost and TabPFN on the raw competition data, not using any of the tricks the ingenious Kagglecommunity applies, such as use of domain knowledge, data cleaning, special feature engineering, postprocessing and ensembling; nevertheless, these techniques can be combined withTabPFN, and we hope that TabPFN’s improved base model performance will allow Kagglers to achieve even better results with them.
